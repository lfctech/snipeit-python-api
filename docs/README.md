# Snipe-IT API Documentation

This directory contains JSON files that represent the schema of the Snipe-IT API resources. These files can be used for documentation generation, API response validation, or to understand the structure of the different API objects.

Each file corresponds to a specific resource in the Snipe-IT API (e.g., `assets.json`, `users.json`).
